# Portfolio Project

This is a personal portfolio web application built with React and Vite. It showcases featured projects with interactive cards, providing links to live demos and source code for each project. The design is responsive and modern, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features
- Responsive grid layout for project cards
- Expandable/collapsible project descriptions
- Links to live demos and source code
- Clean and modular component structure
- **Centralized Data Management**: All static data (profile info, skills, links, etc.) is organized in the `src/data` folder and imported into components. This makes it easy to update content without editing component logic.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Icons**: Icon library for React
- **React Hook Form**: For form handling (if used in contact or other sections)
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests (if used)
- **ESLint**: Linting and code quality

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
